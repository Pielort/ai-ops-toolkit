# Templates Pack — Quickstart (30 minutes)

You bought this so you can **deliver client work like a system**.

This quickstart gives you a fast install path without overthinking.

---

## The only goal
Within 30 minutes you should have:
- A single **System of Record** (where the truth lives)
- A repeatable **Onboarding** workflow that prevents scope chaos
- A repeatable **Delivery** workflow (QA + handoff)
- A **Weekly Report** you can send every Friday without writing from scratch

If you do nothing else, do those.

---

## Pick your “System of Record” (2 minutes)
Choose ONE place where the truth lives. Everything links back to this.

**Recommended:** Notion or Airtable

Create a single workspace/project called:
- `CLIENT OPS — <Client Name>`

Inside it, create 4 sections:
1) **Intake & Scope**
2) **Delivery**
3) **Reporting**
4) **Assets / Links**

---

## Install path (recommended)
### Step 1 — Onboarding System (10 minutes)
Open: `01_Onboarding_System.md`

Copy these pieces into your System of Record:
- Intake checklist
- Scope lock questions
- Kickoff agenda
- Definition of Done

**Why this first?** Onboarding fixes 80% of delivery chaos.

### Step 2 — Delivery System (10 minutes)
Open: `02_Delivery_System.md`

Copy these pieces:
- Delivery checklist
- QA checklist
- Change request policy
- Handoff checklist

### Step 3 — Reporting System (8 minutes)
Open: `03_Reporting_System.md`

Copy this template:
- Weekly report (client-facing)
- Meeting notes → action items format

---

## The "No Chaos" rules (non-negotiable)
If you want this to work, enforce these every time:

1) **Scope is locked before work starts**
   - If scope isn’t written, it doesn’t exist.

2) **Definition of Done is written**
   - You don’t want “almost finished” arguments.

3) **One channel for client decisions**
   - Email or a single Slack channel — not 6 DMs.

4) **Every request becomes a tracked item**
   - No “quick asks” that derail delivery.

5) **Weekly report goes out on a schedule**
   - Your updates should be a process, not a mood.

---

## Optional (but powerful): automation hooks
If you have Make/Zapier, here are the first two automations that actually matter:

1) **Form → CRM → Tasks**
   - New lead/intake → create CRM record → create onboarding tasks

2) **Meeting Notes → Action Items**
   - Notes captured → action items created in task system → owner + due date

If you want me to design the best automation path for your exact stack, that’s what the Audit is for.

## What to do next
- If you’re building yourself: continue with `04_Prompt_Library.md` to speed up client comms.
- If you want speed + confidence: book the Automation Audit and we’ll produce a ranked roadmap.
