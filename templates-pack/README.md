# AI Ops Toolkit — Templates Pack (v0)

This folder contains the **actual deliverables** for the Templates Pack.

## What’s inside
- `00_Quickstart.md` — how to use the pack in 30 minutes
- `01_Onboarding_System.md` — intake + scope control + kickoff
- `02_Delivery_System.md` — delivery checklist + QA + handoff
- `03_Reporting_System.md` — weekly report template + meeting notes → actions
- `04_Prompt_Library.md` — prompts for proposals, updates, summaries, planning

## How to deliver (current)
This repo is the source of truth. For now, delivery can be:
- **Manual:** send clients the links to these files after payment.
- **Automated (next):** add a post-payment delivery page + (optional) gated access.

## Preview component (site)
The site pulls preview copy from these docs (snippets + bullets), so the “product preview” is tied to the real product.
