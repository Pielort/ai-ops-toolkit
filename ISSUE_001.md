# Steven’s AI Ops — Issue #001

**Theme:** Stop buying “AI tools.” Start buying time.

## The point
Most teams don’t need more AI news. They need **one workflow** that reliably turns input → output.

If you’re an agency/freelancer, the highest-leverage automations are the boring ones:
- onboarding
- proposals
- SOPs
- reporting
- repurposing

## 3 practical takeaways
1) **Reliability beats IQ.** If a workflow fails 1 in 3 runs, it’s unusable in client work.
2) **Constraints-first prompts win.** Format, audience, length, and “don’t do” are the difference.
3) **Guardrails are non-negotiable.** Limits, stop conditions, and logging prevent expensive surprises.

## One workflow you can copy today (10 minutes)
**Meeting notes → follow-up email**
- Paste your notes
- Ask for: recap (3 bullets), decisions, action items, next steps
- Send it the same day

## What I’m building next
- A weekly “AI Ops Toolkit” page
- A library of 10-minute workflows
- Short, source-backed breakdowns of what’s actually worth using

Reply with what you do (agency/freelance niche) and I’ll tailor the next pack.
